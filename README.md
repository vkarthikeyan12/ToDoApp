# Compose To-Do, Alarm & Timer App

A simple **Android app** built with **Jetpack Compose** that allows users to:

- Add and delete **To-Do tasks**
- Set an **alarm** using an in-app time picker
- Run a **1-minute timer** with start/reset functionality

This project demonstrates the power of **Compose-only UI**, avoiding traditional XML layouts and themes.
